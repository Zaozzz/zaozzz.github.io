## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong Jianzhu University (entered in 2023). During my undergraduate studies, I have been fortunate to receive guidance from Associate Researcher Guangshun Wei at Shandong University and Associate Professor Ning Yang at Shandong Jianzhu University. 

I hope to obtain the position of Research Assistant in your laboratory for the fall of 2025.
