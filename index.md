## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.sdjzu.edu.cn/jsjkx/index.htm), [Shandong Jianzhu University](https://www.sdjzu.edu.cn/), which I began in 2023. My academic journey has been enriched under the mentorship of [Guangshun Wei](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/weiguangshun/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Ning Yang](https://www.sdjzu.edu.cn/jsjkx/info/1024/4575.htm) from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm). Their guidance has been instrumental in shaping my research interests and academic pursuits.

My primary research focus lies in the areas of **multimodal large models**.
