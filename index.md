## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.sdjzu.edu.cn/jsjkx/index.htm), [Shandong Jianzhu University](https://www.sdjzu.edu.cn/), which I began in 2023. My academic journey has been enriched under the mentorship of Associate Researcher [Guangshun Wei](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/weiguangshun/zh_CN/index.htm) from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm) and Associate Professor [Ning Yang](https://www.sdjzu.edu.cn/jsjkx/xygk/szll2.htm) from [Shandong Jianzhu University](https://www.sdjzu.edu.cn/). Their guidance has been instrumental in shaping my research interests and academic pursuits.

My primary research focus lies in the areas of **multimodal large models**, **multimodal data processing**, and **knowledge distillation**.

I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in these domains and am keen to join your laboratory as a Research Assistant in the fall of 2025.
